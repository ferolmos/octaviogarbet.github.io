Lunching and learning! In order to create the first version of my online resume, I am learning Jekyll's magic.

In the past, I have used some frontend and backend technologies, such as Angular, Grails, React and Java. Now it is time to learn how to use one of the most popular static web generators. While learning I focus on creating my online resume, which is a goal that I have had for a long time.
